## Gameplay Mechanics

- Core Gameplay Mechanics:
    * Hexagonal map containing a wast space, with a lot of workable resources but a few colonizable stars.
    * Ships move between hexes based on speed, which determines, how fast can a ship transition to another hex.
    * Turn based movement - every player queues moves simultaneously, then simulation happen.
    * Combat is concluded using dice rolls. Multiple options of ship type/def/atk (ADV/DISADV based on weapons and armor used, different damage, HP based on ship type)
    * There will be basic adjacency bonuses to ships (example: command ship gives bonus nearby 2 hexes for attack rolls and such)
    * Research that opens further options in economy/ship types
    * Alliances which allow non-aggression/coms trade/research agreements and vassalization
    * Planets can produce ships, but require resources to do so. These can be hauled from space or produced locally, if there are any present.
- Player Controls:
    * Players can control their empire using an online GUI.
- Game Progression:
    * Each game is self-contained. Players start with a planet and a few ships, then progress towards huge empires spanning tens of planets and hundreds of tiles. Space is limited, which will create geopolitical tension, which will be the main point of the game.
- Game Difficulty:
    * Very simple to get into, with the possibility to grow game knowledge to gain an edge over other players.
